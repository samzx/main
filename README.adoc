Welcome to the home of HackEat! HackEat is a next-gen food recommendation and ordering app for the hackers, the programmers, the creators of world bustling and bursting with world-changing ideas but running short on time ‚è∞‚è≥.

* Perfect for the busy software developer or desk hermit: Use _CLI commands_ to accelerate the chore of finding the right food.
* HackEat takes the stress, thinking and time-waste out of deciding what to eat. Order your food in style with developer-friendly commands like `ls` and `mkfood` to stay _in the zone_ even when you're not programming.

== How to Use
Hackers don't need manuals. But there is a User Guide for you to check out. See the links below :)
