== PROJECT: HackEat

---

== Overview

Formerly AddressBook - Level 4, a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Through a 6 week transformation, this software is now known as HackEat.

HackEat is a next-gen food recommendation and ordering app for the hackers, the programmers, the creators of world bustling and bursting with world-changing ideas but running short on time ⏰⏳.

Perfect for the busy software developer or desk hermit: Use CLI commands to accelerate the chore of finding the right food.

HackEat takes the stress, thinking and time-waste out of deciding what to eat. Order your food in style with commands like `order` to stay in the zone even when you’re not programming.

== Summary of contributions

* Major contribution
** What it does
*** `order` command selects a food (if no index specified) and contacts the restaurant via phone and email.
** Justification
*** The application's goal was to make ordering food a non-disruptive experience. Therefore, it was necessary to
automate the ordering process to save the user time and effort required to order food, minimising the toll on the
user's workflow.
** Highlights
*** It was a rewarding experience using APIs and setting up a remote server to process the voice call.

* Minor contribution
** Added Rating field to Food
*** Rating was required for the food selection algorithm to have a better idea of what preferences the user has for
for each food.
* Code contributed: [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W10-B3/main/blob/master/collated/functional/samzx.md[Functional code]] [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W10-B3/main/blob/master/collated/test/samzx.md[Test code]]
