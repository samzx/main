== PROJECT: HackEat

---

== Overview

Formerly AddressBook - Level 4, a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Through a 6 week transformation, this software is now known as HackEat.

_Start of Extract [from: Read Me] written by Jackson Huang_

HackEat is a next-gen food recommendation and ordering app for the hackers, the programmers, the creators of world bustling and bursting with world-changing ideas but running short on time ⏰⏳.

Perfect for the busy software developer or desk hermit: Use CLI commands to accelerate the chore of finding the right food.

HackEat takes the stress, thinking and time-waste out of deciding what to eat. Order your food in style with commands like `order` to stay in the zone even when you’re not programming.

== Future proposals

The use of Twilio API to directly use voice messages.
Can be seen in unused section.

=== Smarter ordering AI agent
Possibly implement smarter speech with `<Gather>` and `<Redirect>`.

1. `<Gather>` gathers data from user in form of speech, and posts to the url /create/:id/response at the REST API.
2. API parses the information and generates new XML data specific to the response at /order/:id/response.
3. `<Redirect>` redirects chat flow to /order/:id/response and retrieves XML data and confirms, repeats or declines the order.
