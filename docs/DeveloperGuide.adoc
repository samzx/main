By: `Team SE-EDU`      Since: `Jun 2016`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `FoodListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

.Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in <<fig-LogicClassDiagram>>
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a food) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Food>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of HackEat (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of HackEat before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th food in HackEat. The current state of HackEat is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new food.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the food was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore HackEat to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores HackEat to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `UndoableCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()`
** Pros: We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist.
** Cons: Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.
* **Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()`
** Pros: Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand.
** Cons: Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the food being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


===== Aspect: Type of commands that can be undone/redone

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies HackEat (`add`, `clear`, `edit`).
** Pros: We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are * lost).
** Cons: User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), * only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`.
* **Alternative 2:** Include all commands.
** Pros: Might be more intuitive for the user.
** Cons: User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address * book and not the view.
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].


===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo
** Pros: Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be * the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update * both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two * different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::userconfig[]
=== Configuring the User Profile

==== Motivation
It's nice to have someone greet you as your friend. HackEat makes its users comfortable and feel
welcomed whenever they open their app. This is possible because a new feature has been implemented that
takes in the user's name and other information. The user is then greeted upon opening the app.

==== Changes to Commands
A new Command class `UserConfigCommand` is created which allows the user to type in `userconfig n/NAME p/PHONE a/ADDRESS [alg/ALLERGY]` to update
their profile.

==== Changes to the Model
In order to support the user profile, a new package was created under the `Model` component, specifically a `user` package.
Inside it contains a `UserProfile` class, which holds the app state of the user's profile. `Allergy` is also a new object
in HackEat, and so an `Allergy` class was created in a new `allergy` package of the `Model` component. In order to support
multiple allergies for a single user, a `UniqueAllergyList` was also created under the same package.

image::model-component-with-user-profile.png[width="600"]

==== Saving to Storage
Executing the `UserConfigCommand` triggers the `model#updateUserProfile` method, which then posts an event to the `EventCenter`
indicating that `HackEat` data has changed. The model data is then saved to XML format for persistent data.

New classes required to support XML of User Profile:

* `XMLAdaptedUserProfile`
* `XMLAdaptedAllergy`

==== Loading from storage
This was quite simple. Only one new method was required to be added to the `AddressBook` class to initialize
an `AddressBook` with the loaded `UserProfile`.

// end::userconfig[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

// tag::changepic[]
=== Changing of Profile Picture

==== What
The `changepic` command allows users to update their profile picture.

==== Why
As developers, we believe in creating applications that build connections with our target users. HackEat
strives to achieve this by providing programmers with an option to spruce up the app a little by adding
their own picture to it. Besides that, the user profile picture could be used in the future for easy identification
of the customer by the deliverer.

==== How
The `changepic` command triggers the opening of a new window which allows the user to easily select an image.
This image is then saved locally and the UI is updated to reflect the change.

==== Current Implementation
image::ChangePicSequenceDiagram.PNG[width="600"]

When HackEat is first launched, a default profile picture is downloaded from the Internet.
As the default profile picture should be displayed when the application starts up, a
`MainApp#initProfilePic` was created to ensure that the application displays the picture.
This picture is stored locally on the same directory as the jar file.
Should the user desire to change the profile picture, the `changepic` command can be utilised.
When the command is executed, a window pops up and the user selects an appropriate image.
The existing profile picture is overwritten by the newly selected image.
Upon successful execution, a new `ProfilePicChangedEvent` will be raised.
This is handled by the `UserProfilePanel` of the `UI` component which then crops the image, if necessary,
and then updates the UI.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Saving the picture
* **Alternative 1:** Saving it in HackEat as a Base64 encoded String
** Pros: It was more intuitive to store the picture together with the user profile in HackEat.

** Cons: Because of the length of the Base64 encoded string, it makes the xml file
very clunky.

* **Alternative 2 (Current choice):** Save it as an image file in the same directory as the jar file.
** Pros: More direct and easier to implement.

** Cons: Use of this application will be restricted to a single user.

* **Alternative 3:** Save the file path in the user profile
** Pros: It was more intuitive to store the file path in the user profile.

** Cons: More tedious than Alternative 2 as a new field would have to be added to the user profile.
Since there exists only one `UserProfile` for this application, such an implementation was
unnecessary.

// end::changepic[]

// tag::edituser[]
=== Editing of profile details

==== What
The `edituser` command allows a user to update their details easily without having to provide all
the compulsory details again.

==== Why
No programmer likes to have his/her flow state broken, especially by a long command that requires
one to key in repetitive details. Hence, the `edituser` command was created to allow programmers to
speedily update their profile details.

==== How
Under the `EditUserCommand`, a copy of the existing user with the updated details is created.
This is then passed on to `model` for the user profile to be updated.

==== Current Implementation
image::EditUserSequenceDiagramLogic.PNG[width="600"]
. Upon parsing of an `EditUserCommand`, an `EditUserDescriptor` object is created.
. The attribute values of this object will then be set to the edited values.
. The `EditUserDescriptor` object will be passed as an argument to the constructor of the `EditUserCommand`.
. The `EditUserCommand` is then preprocessed.
.. The existing user profile is retrieved from `model`.
.. Based on the attributes which have been set in the `EditUserDescriptor` object, a new `UserProfile`
object with the updated attribute values is created.
. The new `UserProfile` is then passed to `model`.
. `model` then updates the user profile of HackEat.
. This causes an event to be raised which then causes HackEat to be saved to persistent storage.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Setting a user's details
* **Alternative 1:** Modifying the user details directly from Logic
** Pros: It was more intuitive to change the details of the existing user profile from the Logic Component.

** Cons: This can result in increased coupling among the classes. As a result, many components would
have to be modified, which renders this method to be more complicated than the alternative.

* **Alternative 2 (Current choice):** Creation of a new EditUserDescriptor object

** Pros: A cleaner implementation where there is less coupling. Less components would have to be modified
and it facilitates the execution of the UndoableCommand.

** Cons: Overhead is incurred as a new copy of the UserProfile has to be created each time the user updates
his/her details.
// end::edituser[]

// tag::order[]
=== `order` command feature

==== What
The order command is the core of the application. It automates the food ordering process. It can automate the food
selection process, to minimise decision making strain, while also sending the order to the restaurant, reducing the
time required to order food.

==== Why
Programmers often ignore their appetite amidst long coding sessions, leaving their stomach rumbling. It is often too
much effort to switch out of the flow state to begin the laborious process of ordering food. HackEat changes this.
With a simple `order` command, the whole process, food selection and ordering, is streamlined.

==== How
===== Overview Flow chart

image::orderer--order-command.png[width="600"]
. Order command searches through existing Foods in the HackEat book
.. Within each Food, a score is derived based on number of factors such as: rating, price and
 allergies.
. Foods will be ordered on a probabilistic basis, making sure a variety when ordering food often.
. The program will email the restaurant with a record and summary of the request for food.
. A phone call will be held to request food.
.. A message generated by the client will be sent to our server.
Server source code can be found here: https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W10-B3/hackeat-server
.. The server will initiate a phone call using a calling service to the chosen food's phone number.
.. A text to voice service will be used to translate text to voice to communicate with the restaurant on the
other end and order a food with a pre-canned message.

image::orderer--sequence.png[width="600"]

It is then assumed that the restaurant will acknowledge the order and deliver the food to the user's address.
The user will need to pay once it has arrived.

==== Current implementations

===== Food Selector
image::orderer--food-selector.png[width="600"]

* Foods are given scores based on ratings, price and allergy.
** A high rating will result in a higher score
** A low price will result in a higher score
** Any allergies that the food matches with the user will immediately give the food a score of 0, eliminating it from
the selection process
* Foods are then given a number, based on their positions, occupying a range equivalent to their score
 (see diagram).
* A random number is selected between 0 and the cumulative score (max running score)
* The random number will land on a food (shown in diagram) and be selected.
* This will select a food probabilistically, based on the scores. A higher score will have a higher chance of selection.

===== Order Manager

* Sets up a session and generates access to email server
* Emails restaurant the order details, an order record and summary.
* Initiates a phone call to the food's phone number
** v1.4 has implemented this on client side via Twilio, but was changed due to current rejection of the use of the
library.
** Therefore the phone calling was delegated to a remote server, moved out of the client.
** The remote server accepts a HTTP POST request with the message details, and create a phone call based on the message.

==== Design considerations

- Email was used to avoid importing a large library and can be used as a record summary for the restaurant.
- Voice call for ordering food was also chosen as it is Universal to all restaurants that deliver food.
Some restaurants do nto have Uber Eats or Food Panda service.
- A server was used to handle the phone call to keep the client lightweight, and to avoid any
library import complications.

==== Alternatives and future considerations

===== Existing food ordering platform API
A promising alternative is to use an existing API from UberEats or other food ordering services to allow more services
added such as: delivery time tracking, more restaurants. This would guarantee the service more reliably.

===== Smarter ordering AI agent
Possibly implement smarter speech with `<Gather>` and `<Redirect>` (Twilio example).

1. `<Gather>` gathers data from user in form of speech, and posts to the url /create/:id/response at the REST API.
2. API parses the information and generates new XML data specific to the response at /order/:id/response.
3. `<Redirect>` redirects chat flow to /order/:id/response and retrieves XML data and confirms, repeats or declines the order.

// end::order[]

// tag::add[]
=== Interactive `add` feature

==== What
Users can type in `add`, and then the system will take the user through a set of prompts to get the information. This
is a more natural way of using the CLI to get food.

==== Why
Our goal is to reduce the amount of thinking that programmers have to do to get the food that they want. Memorising and
typing out the entire `add` command requires extra cognitive effort.

==== How
It was quickly realised that extra application state was necessary for managing interactive flows between a user and the
system. This extra state includes:

- Knowing if a user is actively engaged in an interaction, so that new inputs are interpreted in the context of this
existing interaction
- Knowing how far a user has progressed in the active interaction
- Intermediate application data that has not yet been committed to storage (e.g. the first attribute `Name` needs to
be stored in memory until the last attribute is read from the user, at which point the whole `Food` with all its
attributes can be saved in the `Storage` component)

==== Current implementation
The state and logic that handle the above requirements are implemented in the abstract `Session` class as well as its
concrete, command-specific child classes (e.g. `SessionAddCommand`).

===== Simplified sequence diagram for starting or continuing a `Session`
image::add-command-interactive-start.png[width="600"]

==== Design considerations

===== Extensibility
The interactive mode of communication between the user and the system was built with extensibility in mind.
The abstract `Session` class contains the common methods that control the logical flow of any interactive command.
The abstract methods `Session#parseInputForMultivaluedField` and `Session#parseInputForField` are overidden
by concrete subclasses, allowing each specific type of `Command` to parse and store user input relevant to its own fields.
Hence, the implementation of an interactive `EditCommand` and `OrderCommand` would be convenient and simple owing to important
architectural decisions made from the beginning.

===== Model or Logic?
It was difficult to choose where to place the `Session`, `SessionAddCommand`, `SessionManager` and `SessionInterface`
interface and classes. These classes and interface handle both application data (i.e. they should belong in the `Model`)
as well as text parsing (i.e. they could also belong in the `Logic` component). We opted for the simplistic solution of
placing it all in the `Model` component, with some coupling with the `Command` class which belongs to the `Logic`
component.

An alternative architectural design would be to have `SessionData` and `SessionLogic` separated across `Model` and
`Logic` components. The advantage of this design is that it adheres to the strict definitions of the functions
of each of these components. The disadvantage, which is much more costly, is the increased coupling between these separate components and classes. It is much more convenient to simply combine the state and logic for `Sessions` in a single component to reduce coupling and increase cohesion, making developer efficiency higher and code organisation more
simple.

=== Chat UI

==== What
The `ResultDisplay` was replaced with a `ChatPanel`. The system's messages and the user's messages are now shown
as chat messages in a chat history. The message bubbles are color coordinated based on whether the message is
a user message, a failed system message, or a successful system message.

==== Why
The chat UI, like the interactive `add` command, aims to give our target users (hungry programmers) a fun and natural way to
manage food and food ordering. The commands are still CLI-based, but now there is an added sense of interaction and novelty
that delights our users.

==== How
The chat UI consists of the following set of nested JavaFX components, displayed in the object diagram below.

image::object-diagram-chat-ui.png[width="600"]

When the user presses `Enter` in the `CommandBox` UI component, a `NewUserMessageAvailableEvent` event is posted to the `EventCenter`.
The `ChatPanel` is subscribed to such events, and a new message is created and added to the UI when such an event is received. The same
approach applies to the handling of `NewResultAvailableEvents`, which represent the system's responses to user input.

// end::chat[]

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all foods in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in HackEat, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in HackEat.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/food/Food.java[`Food`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a food, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/food/Food.java[`Food`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. Loop through each food, and remove the `tag` from each food.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `AddressBook#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.
*** The current codebase has a flaw in tags management. Tags no longer in use by anyone may still exist on the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. This may cause some tests to fail. See issue  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/753[`#753`] for more information about this flaw.
*** The solution PR has a temporary fix for the flaw mentioned above in its first commit.
****

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your address book application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last food in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside food cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.
+
**Before**

**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-tag-after.png[width="300"]

****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/FoodCard.java[the `FoodCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `FoodCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/799[PR] for the full solution.

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever HackEat is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of foods when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of foods whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of people status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of foods status bar.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/803[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]
==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving HackEat to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves HackEat after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for HackEat storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that HackEat can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAddressBookStorage.java[`XmlAddressBookStorage`] class.

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `addressbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a food specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first food to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first food.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UndoableCommand.java[`UndoableCommand`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `executeUndoableCommand()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `FoodCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/FoodCard.java[`FoodCard`] s to display a remark for each food later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/FoodListCard.fxml[`FoodListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/FoodCard.java[`FoodCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/FoodCardHandle.java[`FoodCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/food/Food.java[`Food`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/food/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Food` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/food/Food.java[`Food`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/food/Food.java[`Food`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the food will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedFood` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Food` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedFood.java[`XmlAdaptedFood`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidFoodAddressBook.xml`, `typicalFoodsAddressBook.xml`, `validAddressBook.xml` etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `FoodBuilder`
Since `Food` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/FoodBuilder.java[`FoodBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/food/Food.java[`Food`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/FoodBuilder.java[`FoodBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the food that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Food` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalFoods.java[`TypicalFoods`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `FoodCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/FoodCard.java[`FoodCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/FoodCard.java[`FoodCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Food` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysFood(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a food.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.

== Product Scope

*Target user profile*:

* Developers/Hackers
** is picky and has a need to manage/order a significant number of pre-approved foods
** prefer desktop apps over other types
** can type fast
** prefers typing over mouse input
** is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps
** busy working on projects and immersed to change train of thought
** does not care about their body/health and willing to order food to doorstep

*Value proposition*: Order food with as little disruption as possible to the user's workflow

=== Feature contribution
*Major Enhancements:*

* Order command - Sam
** Allows users to order food from the HackEat book. Designed to choose a food that best suits the scenario, making it
trustworthy enough for hackers that are too lazy to order themselves.
* Interactive, chat-like commands - Jackson
** Allows the user to use commands without memorising their format. Simply respond to simple prompts given by the application.
* User Profile - Cheryl
** Allows the user to view and update their personal details. Creates a personalized experience for the user and enables food
to be delivered to wherever the user is.


*Minor Enhancements:*

* Addition of User profile - Jackson
** User profile will save the preferences of the user, including allergies and how frugal they are. It also stores
personal information so the `order` command can order food to their address.
* Addition of Price property - Cheryl
** Price property is required to track budgeting and control expenses. If the user is frugal, expensive foods will be
ordered less frequently.
* Addition of Rating property - Sam
** Rating property of a food is essential to gather knowledge on what food the user enjoys. Highly rated foods will be
recommended more often, until it is too frequent.

== Non Functional Requirements

.  Should work on any <<mainstream-os,mainstream OS>> as long as it has Java `1.8.0_60` or higher installed.
.  Should be able to hold up to 1000 foods without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
.  A programmer should be able to select and order food faster than using a mobile application like UberEats, Foodora, etc. given that the user has set-up his/her food preferences.
.  The security measures required for safe handling of payments, home addresses and <<credit-card-details, credit card details>> should be industry-standard.
.  Complex tasks such as payment should be outsourced to existing, leading payment providers such as Stripe so that we can benefit from well-developed products.
.  A reliable <<food-delivery-network, food delivery network>> should be used to actually fulfill the food orders and deliveries.
.  The food delivery services we use to power the backend of the app should offer a <<java-api, Java API>>.
.  The user experience should be similar to the <<environment, environment>> that programmers are used.
.  After asking for a food suggestion, the system should respond within 1 second.
.  The service provided by us should be cost-neutral or profitable.
.  The user interface should be simple and minimise distractions so that programmers can continue with their work in a focused manner.
.  A user should not be bored with the food that the app suggests and orders, as a certain level of novelty and surprise must be provided with each experience.

== Instructions for Manual Testing

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

[NOTE]
These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on; testers are expected to do more _exploratory_ testing.

=== Launch and Shutdown

. Initial launch

.. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder
.. Double-click the jar file +
   Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

. Saving window preferences

.. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.
.. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file. +
   Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

=== Adding a food interactively
. Start the interactive command:
.. Type `add` followed by 0 or more whitespaces.
.. Type `Chinese Hot Pot` for the food's name.
.. Type `abcadsajdl` for the phone number to get a failure message.
.. Type `12319313123` for a correct phone number.
.. Press Enter for the rest of the fields until the `Success` message is received.
.. Check that the food was indeed added in the food panel on the left.

. Responsive width of message
.. Messages should be at most three-quarters of the width of the chat panel.
.. Resize the window to see automatic resizing of the maximum width of the message bubbles.
.. Type in a really long message (e.g., repeating the letter `a` 50 times) in response to any of the prompts. The text should wrap properly and not exceed three-quarters of the chat panel's width.

=== Deleting a food
